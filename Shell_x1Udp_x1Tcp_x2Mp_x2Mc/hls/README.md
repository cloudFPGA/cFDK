#  cloudFPGA / SHELL / hls*

This directory contains the High-Level Synthesis (HLS) code used by the Network Transport and Session (NTS) stack of the cloudFPGA platform. 

## Preliminary
This codes was initialy developed by the Xilinx Dublin Labs who kindly acepted to share it with the cloudFPGA project via the GitHub repository: https://github.com/XilinxDublinLabs/arches
In 2018, the code was ported and adapted for the needs and specificities of the cloudFPGA platform.


## HLS Coding Style and Naming Conventions
Please consider reading the following HLS naming conventions document before diving or contributing to this part of the cloudFPGA project: [TODO - Link to a MD file]
