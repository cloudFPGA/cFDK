# Memory Mapped IO (MMIO)
         
This document describes the design of the **Memory Mapped IO (MMIO)** sub-system used by the _cloudFPGA_ platform.

## Overview
A block diagram of **`MMIO`** is depicted in Figure [TODO-Under construction]. It features a ...
   

## HLS Coding Style and Naming Conventions
The design of **`MEM`** uses some specific HDL and HLS naming rules to ease the description and the understanding of
 its architecture. Please consider reading the two documents [**HDL coding style and naming conventions**](https://github.com/cloudFPGA/cFDK/blob/master/DOC/MMIO/../hdl-naming-conventions.md)
 and [**HLS coding style and naming conventions**](https://github.com/cloudFPGA/cFDK/blob/master/DOC/MMIO/./hls-naming-conventions.md) before diving into the code or starting
 to contribute to this part of the cloudFPGA project.

## List of Components
The following table lists the sub-components of **`MMIO`** and provides a link to their documentation as well as their
architecture body. 

| Entity          | Description                 | Architecture
|:--------------- |:----------------------------|:--------------
| **TODO**        | Under construction          | Todo 
| **TODO**        | Under construction          | Todo 
| **TODO**        | Under construction          | Todo
