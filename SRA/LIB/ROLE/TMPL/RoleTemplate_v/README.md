#  **ABOUT: _~/ROLE/FMKU60/Role_**

## Overview

This directory contains a template version of the ROLE that can interface with the default version of the SHELL used by the FMKU60. This default version is the one that consits of: 
        - a TCP/IP stack (NTS0) over the 10Gb/s Ethernet interface #0 (ETH0),
        - two 8GB DDR4 memory channels (MC0,MC1).
