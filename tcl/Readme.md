# TopFlash synthesis & implementation

## Overview

This directory contains the Tcl scripts for invoking the Vivado tools in batch mode.
Use these scripts to create a TCL-based project design flow of the current TOP. 

**There are currently two ways to generate a Bitstream:**
1. With the SHELL imported and packaged as IP Core 
2. With the SHELL imported as complete source codes 

## HOWTO 

### 1. Shell as IP Core 

Work in Progress 

### 2. Shell imported with sources 

Run
```
make full_src
```
